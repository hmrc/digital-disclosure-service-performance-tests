# Default behaviour is to run all journeys. If that is not what you need you can specify the list of journeys to run
#journeysToRun = [
#   hello-world-1,
#   hello-world-3
#]

# You can specify the same list of journeys via environment variables:
# journeysToRun.0 = hello-world-1
# journeysToRun.1 = hello-world-3
